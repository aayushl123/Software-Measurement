<i>25</i>&nbsp; * during ODE integration.
<i>26</i>&nbsp; *
<i>27</i>&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;Some events can be triggered at discrete times as an ODE problem
<i>28</i>&nbsp; * is solved. This occurs for example when the integration process
<i>29</i>&nbsp; * should be stopped as some state is reached (G-stop facility) when the
<i>30</i>&nbsp; * precise date is unknown a priori, or when the derivatives have
<i>31</i>&nbsp; * discontinuities, or simply when the user wants to monitor some
<i>32</i>&nbsp; * states boundaries crossings.
<i>33</i>&nbsp; * &lt;/p&gt;
<i>34</i>&nbsp; *
<i>35</i>&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;These events are defined as occurring when a &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;
<i>36</i>&nbsp; * switching function sign changes.&lt;/p&gt;
<i>37</i>&nbsp; *
<i>38</i>&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;Since events are only problem-dependent and are triggered by the
<i>39</i>&nbsp; * independent &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; variable and the state vector, they can
<i>40</i>&nbsp; * occur at virtually any time, unknown in advance. The integrators will
<i>41</i>&nbsp; * take care to avoid sign changes inside the steps, they will reduce
<i>42</i>&nbsp; * the step size when such an event is detected in order to put this
<i>43</i>&nbsp; * event exactly at the end of the current step. This guarantees that
<i>44</i>&nbsp; * step interpolation (which always has a one step scope) is relevant
<i>45</i>&nbsp; * even in presence of discontinuities. This is independent from the
<i>46</i>&nbsp; * stepsize control provided by integrators that monitor the local
<i>47</i>&nbsp; * error (this event handling feature is available for all integrators,
<i>48</i>&nbsp; * including fixed step ones).&lt;/p&gt;

<i>67</i>&nbsp;
<i>68</i>&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;The discrete events are generated when the sign of this
<i>69</i>&nbsp;     * switching function changes. The integrator will take care to change
<i>70</i>&nbsp;     * the stepsize in such a way these events occur exactly at step boundaries.
<i>71</i>&nbsp;     * The switching function must be continuous in its roots neighborhood
<i>72</i>&nbsp;     * (but not necessarily smooth), as the integrator will need to find its
<i>73</i>&nbsp;     * roots to locate precisely the events.&lt;/p&gt;
<i>74</i>&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;Also note that the integrator expect that once an event has occurred,
<i>75</i>&nbsp;     * the sign of the switching function at the start of the next step (i.e.
<i>76</i>&nbsp;     * just after the event) is the opposite of the sign just before the event.
<i>77</i>&nbsp;     * This consistency between the steps &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be preserved,
<i>78</i>&nbsp;     * otherwise {@link org.apache.commons.math4.exception.NoBracketingException
<i>79</i>&nbsp;     * exceptions} related to root not being bracketed will occur.&lt;/p&gt;
<i>80</i>&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;This need for consistency is sometimes tricky to achieve. A typical
<i>81</i>&nbsp;     * example is using an event to model a ball bouncing on the floor. The first
<i>82</i>&nbsp;     * idea to represent this would be to have {@code g(t) = h(t)} where h is the
<i>83</i>&nbsp;     * height above the floor at time {@code t}. When {@code g(t)} reaches 0, the
<i>84</i>&nbsp;     * ball is on the floor, so it should bounce and the typical way to do this is
<i>85</i>&nbsp;     * to reverse its vertical velocity. However, this would mean that before the
<i>86</i>&nbsp;     * event {@code g(t)} was decreasing from positive values to 0, and after the
<i>87</i>&nbsp;     * event {@code g(t)} would be increasing from 0 to positive values again.
<i>88</i>&nbsp;     * Consistency is broken here! The solution here is to have {@code g(t) = sign
<i>89</i>&nbsp;     * * h(t)}, where sign is a variable with initial value set to {@code +1}. Each
<i>90</i>&nbsp;     * time {@link #eventOccurred(FieldODEStateAndDerivative, boolean) eventOccurred}
<i>91</i>&nbsp;     * method is called, {@code sign} is reset to {@code -sign}. This allows the
<i>92</i>&nbsp;     * {@code g(t)} function to remain continuous (and even smooth) even across events,
<i>93</i>&nbsp;     * despite {@code h(t)} is not. Basically, the event is used to &lt;em&gt;fold&lt;/em&gt;
<i>94</i>&nbsp;     * {@code h(t)} at bounce points, and {@code sign} is used to &lt;em&gt;unfold&lt;/em&gt; it
<i>95</i>&nbsp;     * back, so the solvers sees a {@code g(t)} function which behaves smoothly even
<i>96</i>&nbsp;     * across events.&lt;/p&gt;

<i>136</i>&nbsp;     * handleStep(interpolator, isLast)} is to call this method first and
<i>137</i>&nbsp;     * &lt;code&gt;handleStep&lt;/code&gt; afterwards. This scheduling allows the integrator to

<i>139</i>&nbsp;     * handler to make it aware the step will be the last one if this method
