/**
 * A {@code Scheduler} is an object that specifies an API for scheduling
 * units of work provided in the form of {@link Runnable}s to be
 * executed without delay (effectively as soon as possible), after a specified time delay or periodically
 * and represents an abstraction over an asynchronous boundary that ensures
 * these units of work get executed by some underlying task-execution scheme
 * (such as custom Threads, event loop, {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor Executor} or Actor system)
 * with some uniform properties and guarantees regardless of the particular underlying
 * scheme.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * You can get various standard, RxJava-specific instances of this class via
 * the static methods of the {@link io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers} utility class.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The so-called {@link Worker}s of a {@code Scheduler} can be created via the {@link #createWorker()} method which allow the scheduling
 * of multiple {@link Runnable} tasks in an isolated manner. {@code Runnable} tasks scheduled on a {@code Worker} are guaranteed to be
 * executed sequentially and in a non-overlapping fashion. Non-delayed {@code Runnable} tasks are guaranteed to execute in a
 * First-In-First-Out order but their execution may be interleaved with delayed tasks.
 * In addition, outstanding or running tasks can be cancelled together via
 * {@link Worker#dispose()} without affecting any other {@code Worker} instances of the same {@code Scheduler}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Implementations of the {@link #scheduleDirect} and {@link Worker#schedule} methods are encouraged to call the {@link io.reactivex.plugins.RxJavaPlugins#onSchedule(Runnable)}
 * method to allow a scheduler hook to manipulate (wrap or replace) the original {@code Runnable} task before it is submitted to the
 * underlying task-execution scheme.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The default implementations of the {@code scheduleDirect} methods provided by this abstract class
 * delegate to the respective {@code schedule} methods in the {@link Worker} instance created via {@link #createWorker()}
 * for each individual {@link Runnable} task submitted. Implementors of this class are encouraged to provide
 * a more efficient direct scheduling implementation to avoid the time and memory overhead of creating such {@code Worker}s
 * for every task.
 * This delegation is done via special wrapper instances around the original {@code Runnable} before calling the respective
 * {@code Worker.schedule} method. Note that this can lead to multiple {@code RxJavaPlugins.onSchedule} calls and potentially
 * multiple hooks applied. Therefore, the default implementations of {@code scheduleDirect} (and the {@link Worker#schedulePeriodically(Runnable, long, long, TimeUnit)})
 * wrap the incoming {@code Runnable} into a class that implements the {@link io.reactivex.schedulers.SchedulerRunnableIntrospection}
 * interface which can grant access to the original or hooked {@code Runnable}, thus, a repeated {@code RxJavaPlugins.onSchedule}
 * can detect the earlier hook and not apply a new one over again.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The default implementation of {@link #now(TimeUnit)} and {@link Worker#now(TimeUnit)} methods to return current
 * {@link System#currentTimeMillis()} value in the desired time unit. Custom {@code Scheduler} implementations can override this
 * to provide specialized time accounting (such as virtual time to be advanced programmatically).
 * Note that operators requiring a {@code Scheduler} may rely on either of the {@code now()} calls provided by
 * {@code Scheduler} or {@code Worker} respectively, therefore, it is recommended they represent a logically
 * consistent source of the current time.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The default implementation of the {@link Worker#schedulePeriodically(Runnable, long, long, TimeUnit)} method uses
 * the {@link Worker#schedule(Runnable, long, TimeUnit)} for scheduling the {@code Runnable} task periodically.
 * The algorithm calculates the next absolute time when the task should run again and schedules this execution
 * based on the relative time between it and {@link Worker#now(TimeUnit)}. However, drifts or changes in the
 * system clock could affect this calculation either by scheduling subsequent runs too frequently or too far apart.
 * Therefore, the default implementation uses the {@link #clockDriftTolerance()} value (set via
 * {@code rx2.scheduler.drift-tolerance} in minutes) to detect a drift in {@link Worker#now(TimeUnit)} and
 * re-adjust the absolute/relative time calculation accordingly.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The default implementations of {@link #start()} and {@link #shutdown()} do nothing and should be overridden if the
 * underlying task-execution scheme supports stopping and restarting itself.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If the {@code Scheduler} is shut down or a {@code Worker} is disposed, the {@code schedule} methods
 * should return the {@link io.reactivex.disposables.Disposables#disposed()} singleton instance indicating the shut down/disposed
 * state to the caller. Since the shutdown or dispose can happen from any thread, the {@code schedule} implementations
 * should make best effort to cancel tasks immediately after those tasks have been submitted to the
 * underlying task-execution scheme if the shutdown/dispose was detected after this submission.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * All methods on the {@code Scheduler} and {@code Worker} classes should be thread safe.

     * {@link Flowable} otherwise any work scheduled on the returned

     * &lt;p&gt;
     * When {@link Scheduler#createWorker()} is invoked a {@link Flowable} of
     * {@link Completable}s is onNext'd to the combinator to be flattened. If
     * the inner {@link Flowable} is not immediately subscribed to an calls to
     * {@link Worker#schedule} are buffered. Once the {@link Flowable} is
     * subscribed to actions are then onNext'd as {@link Completable}s.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Finally the actions scheduled on the parent {@link Scheduler} when the
     * inner most {@link Completable}s are subscribed to.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * When the {@link Worker} is unsubscribed the {@link Completable} emits an

     * function never onError.

     *  // use merge max concurrent to limit the number of concurrent
     *  // callbacks two at a time
     *  return Completable.merge(Flowable.merge(workers), 2);
     * });
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This is a slightly different way to limit the concurrency but it has some
     * interesting benefits and drawbacks to the method above. It works by
     * limited the number of concurrent {@link Worker}s rather than individual
     * actions. Generally each {@link Flowable} uses its own {@link Worker}.
     * This means that this will essentially limit the number of concurrent
     * subscribes. The danger comes from using operators like
     * {@link Flowable#zip(org.reactivestreams.Publisher, org.reactivestreams.Publisher, io.reactivex.functions.BiFunction)} where
     * subscribing to the first {@link Flowable} could deadlock the
     * subscription to the second.
     *

     * Scheduler limitScheduler = Schedulers.computation().when(workers -&amp;gt; {
     *  // use merge max concurrent to limit the number of concurrent
     *  // Flowables two at a time
     *  return Completable.merge(Flowable.merge(workers, 2));
     * });
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     *
     * Slowing down the rate to no more than than 1 a second. This suffers from
     * the same problem as the one above I could find an {@link Flowable}
     * operator that limits the rate without dropping the values (aka leaky
     * bucket algorithm).
     *
     * &lt;pre&gt;
